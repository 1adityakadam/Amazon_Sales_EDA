This project performs <a href='https://github.com/1adityakadam/Automated_EDA_with_ydata_profiling/blob/main/amazon_sales_analysis.pdf'> automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</a> on an <a href='https://github.com/1adityakadam/Automated_EDA_with_ydata_profiling/blob/main/amazon_sale_report.csv'>Amazon sales dataset</a> from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlock-profits-with-e-commerce-sales-data'>Kaggle</a> using the `ydata_profiling` library (formerly known as pandas-profiling).
The goal is to generate a comprehensive HTML report containing key insights about the data, including descriptive statistics, data types, missing values, correlations, and more. 
This automated approach streamlines the initial data understanding process, enabling faster and more efficient analysis of sales trends, product performance, 
and customer behavior within the Amazon marketplace. The dataset includes features such as order details, product information, shipping addresses, and sales metrics.

Power BI dashboard is designed to visualize Amazon sales data. The dashboard provides insights into order fulfillment, sales revenue, product preferences, and shipping methods. It is tailored for business intelligence purposes to monitor sales performance and identify trends.
